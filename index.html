        </h2>
        <p class="lead">Kizunacraft is a Minecraft mod that uses Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.9 created by Toby "Wehavecookies56" Wishart. The mod is inspired by the Spring 2016 anime series "Kiznaiver" where the characters are "Bound by their wounds".</p>

        </h2>
        <p class="lead">Kizunacraft allows you to split any damage taken between other players. So if you are playing with one other person something that would deal 10 hearts of damage to you would deal 5 hearts of damage to you and the other player. Players that are bound by their wounds are known as "<em>Kiznaivers</em></p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Getting started
        </h2>
      <p class="lead">You'll need a <em>Kizuna System Implant</em> in order to become a Kiznaiver, crafting recipe to the right. Once you have a <em>Kizuna System Implant</em> right click while holding it to install it, you have now become a Kiznaiver. To connect your wounds with another player you must right click a player with an empty hand <strong>who is also</strong> a Kiznaiver. Once you have done this damage taken by either of you will be split between you. To disconnect you must die which will cause you to drop the implant and you will no longer be a Kiznaiver. If you need to see who you are connected to you can use the "/kiznaivers" command, this will display a list of connected players in green and grey text. Green text means they are online and you will share damage, grey text means they are offline and you will not share damage.</p>
